    <h1>ECMAScript Overview</h1>
    <p>ECMAScript is object-based: basic language and host facilities are provided by objects, and an ECMAScript program is a cluster of communicating objects. In ECMAScript, an <em>object</em> is a collection of zero or more <em>properties</em> each with <em>attributes</em> that determine how each property can be used&mdash;for example, when the Writable attribute for a property is set to *false*, any attempt by executed ECMAScript code to assign a different value to the property fails. Properties are containers that hold other objects, <em>primitive values</em>, or <em>functions</em>. A primitive value is a member of one of the following built-in types: <b>Undefined</b>, <b>Null</b>, <b>Boolean</b>, <b>Number</b>, <b>BigInt</b>, <b>String</b>, <del>and</del> <b>Symbol<del>;</del></b><ins>, <b>Record</b> and <b>Tuple;</b></ins> an object is a member of the built-in type <b>Object</b>; and a function is a callable object. A function that is associated with an object via a property is called a <em>method</em>.</p>
    <p>ECMAScript defines a collection of <em>built-in objects</em> that round out the definition of ECMAScript entities. These built-in objects include the global object; objects that are fundamental to the runtime semantics of the language including `Object`, `Function`, `Boolean`, `Symbol`, <ins>`Record`, `Tuple`</ins> and various `Error` objects; objects that represent and manipulate numeric values including `Math`, `Number`, and `Date`; the text processing objects `String` and `RegExp`; objects that are indexed collections of values including `Array` and nine different kinds of Typed Arrays whose elements all have a specific numeric data representation; keyed collections including `Map` and `Set` objects; objects supporting structured data including the `JSON` object, `ArrayBuffer`, `SharedArrayBuffer`, and `DataView`; objects supporting control abstractions including generator functions and `Promise` objects; and reflection objects including `Proxy` and `Reflect`.</p>

    <h1>ECMAScript Overview</h1>
    <p>
      ECMAScript is object-based: basic language and host facilities are
      provided by objects, and an ECMAScript program is a cluster of
      communicating objects. In ECMAScript, an <em>object</em> is a collection
      of zero or more <em>properties</em> each with <em>attributes</em> that
      determine how each property can be used&mdash;for example, when the
      Writable attribute for a property is set to *false*, any attempt by
      executed ECMAScript code to assign a different value to the property
      fails. Properties are containers that hold other objects,
      <em>primitive values</em>, or <em>functions</em>. A primitive value is a
      member of one of the following built-in types: <b>Undefined</b>,
      <b>Null</b>, <b>Boolean</b>, <b>Number</b>, <b>BigInt</b>, <b>String</b>,
      <del>and</del> <b>Symbol<del>;</del></b
      ><ins>, <b>Record</b>, and <b>Tuple;</b></ins> an object is a member of the
      built-in type <b>Object</b>; and a function is a callable object. A
      function that is associated with an object via a property is called a
      <em>method</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      ECMAScript defines a collection of <em>built-in objects</em> that round
      out the definition of ECMAScript entities. These built-in objects include
      the global object; objects that are fundamental to the runtime semantics
      of the language including `Object`, `Function`, `Boolean`, `Symbol`,
      <ins>`Record`, `Tuple`</ins> and various `Error` objects; objects that
      represent and manipulate numeric values including `Math`, `Number`, and
      `Date`; the text processing objects `String` and `RegExp`; objects that
      are indexed collections of values including `Array` and nine different
      kinds of Typed Arrays whose elements all have a specific numeric data
      representation; keyed collections including `Map` and `Set` objects;
      objects supporting structured data including the `JSON` object,
      `ArrayBuffer`, `SharedArrayBuffer`, and `DataView`; objects supporting
      control abstractions including generator functions and `Promise` objects;
      and reflection objects including `Proxy` and `Reflect`.
